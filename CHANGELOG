--- CHANGELOG ---
--- PyFMI-FUTURE ---
    * New function `get_log_categories` for `FMUModelBase2` to retrieve both log

    * Changes to `FMUModelBase2.set_debug_logging()`
      * Now operate on lists of strings instead of bytes.
      * Removed requirement that categories to be set are available via `get_log_categories()`.
    * Added new option `step_size_downsampling_factor` to `Master` algorithm.
      This allows setting reduced input/output update rates on a per-model basis.

--- PyFMI-2.18.3 ---
    * Fixed a bug introduced in PyFMI 2.18.0 causing incorrect result storing for `boolean` and `enum` variables
      with `result_handling = "binary"` (default).

    * Removed deprecation of `get_variable_data`, it is recommended to use `get_trajectory` anyways.

--- PyFMI-2.18.0 ---
    * Added new class `DynamicDiagnosticsUtils` in `pyfmi.common.diagnostics` providing
      various utility functions for computing additional diagnostics variables derived
      from those stored during simulation with `dynamic_diagnostics = True`.

    * `pyfmi.common.io.ResultReader` new features:
        * Get all variable names via `get_variable_names`.
        * Get multiple trajectories via `get_trajectories`.
    * Deprecations: 
        * `pyfmi.common.io.ResultStorage`, use `pyfmi.common.io.ResultReader` instead.

           use `get_variable_names` function instead.
        * `ResultCSVTextual`, `ResultStorageMemory`, `ResultDymolaTextual` and `ResultDymolaBinary`:
          `get_variable_data`, use `get_trajectory` instead.

    * Increased robustness of getting the `supports` attribute from ResultHandlers.
    * Fixed an Exception when using `dynamic_diagnostics` and scalar `atol`.
    * Updated FMIL used in GitHub workflows to version 3.0a4, updated setup.py to account for changes in FMIL.

    * Note: With Assimulo >= 3.4.1 CVode adds supports relative tolerance vectors, see Assimulo README for details.
    * Added partial support for rtol vectors in simulate(): Values need to be equal except for zeros & requires support from used solver.

    * Changed Jacobian to use nominals retrieved via fmu.nominals_continuous_states instead of fmu.get_variable_nominal(<valueref>).
