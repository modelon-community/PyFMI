--- CHANGELOG ---
--- PyFMI-2.9.5 ---
    * Updated structure of diagnostics data and renamed several of the variables. The top level prefix has also been changed from Diagnostics to @Diagnostics, hence the error check for name clashes has been removed.

--- PyFMI-2.9.3 ---
    * Added an internal class variable in ResultHandlerFile to keep track of file position where the data header ends.

    * Made error check with 'dynamic_diagnostics' less restrictive to also allow custom result handlers. In 2.9.1 only a binary result handler was allowed.

--- PyFMI-2.9.1 ---
    * Added new simulation option 'dynamic_diagnostics' to better illustrate the purpose of enabling 'logging' when 'result_handling' is set to True.
    * Updated also such that the text file 'model identifier + _debug.txt' is no longer generated when logging to the binary result file.

--- PyFMI-2.9 ---
    * Saving diagnostic data in binary result file instead of log file.
